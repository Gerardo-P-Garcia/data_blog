      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>The COVID-19 pandemic cast a spotlight on the need for reliable data and responsible analysis to track and minimize the loss of human life.Among the many datasets and reports made available in recent months,this author’s work caught my attention, compiling large amounts of data into one report that was easy to maintain.</description>

      <description>Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter movement brought attention to police violence against the Black community and the people overall, with protests spanning the globe bringing additional scrutiny and evidence against long-established practices. A wealth of information has followed, including self-recorded videos and data, allowing us to connect systemic-level violence with the intensity of individual shootings that some may have dismissed as anecdotal.</description>

      <description>Let’s see if this graph works, but first we will see if we can avoid having code appearing in the intial summary of the post. A word limit is used for the start of the post, so filling in this space with text before any rendering with R occurs should fix the problem. If not, changing the word limit to a smaller value is the next step.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
